# Bike sharing case study
BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing service, experienced revenue decline during the COVID-19 pandemic and seeks a recovery plan. The company aims to analyze post-pandemic bike demand to surpass competitors and boost profits. It hired a consultancy to identify key factors influencing demand and their predictive power. BoomBikes collected detailed data on daily bike usage, including meteorological and lifestyle factors. This analysis will guide their strategy for market revival. The goal is sustained growth in the post-lockdown period.

## The bike service company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?
- How well those variables describe the bike demands?
